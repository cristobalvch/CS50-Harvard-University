            <h2>Biography</h2>
            </p>
        <p class= 'main-bio'> This is my personal music project called 'Astromantico'. It's raised under the musical eaves, influenced by artist of all musical styles of Rock and Folk;
        from Slayer through John Lennon until Iron & Wine. We like singing songs and playing guitar on the weekends on a good Sunday
        afternoon, in which is why our musics try to reflect when musical simplicity serves as the language of the soul and the daily
        emotionality of being. We want you to be able to listen our music while having a coffee and thinking about how you are going to
        fix the world.</p>
